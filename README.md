# Relative Binnning 
Relative binning framework to perform parameter estimation for waveforms with higher order modes and precession

The lalsuite needs to be installed from Geraint Pratten's repository: git@github.com:GeraintPratten/lalsuite_gp.git

The version of lalsuite has a utility function that can calcuate Euler angls (lalsim.SimIMRPhenomXPMSAAngles) on the user specified frequency grid.
